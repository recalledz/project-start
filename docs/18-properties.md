21.1 Learning Speed

Affects all skill XP gains.

Range: 0.5× at INT 0 → 2.0× at INT 10

21.2 Qi Regeneration (Qi/s)

Determines how much Qi the sect orb or a cultivator gains per second.

QiRegen = ([areaQi] × (4 + ElementStrength) × (0.5 + 0.05 × QiSense) / 320)
        + (0.0002 × MaxQi)
        + globalQi

ElementStrength: +2 or –2 modifier based on elemental fengshui within the cultivation room.
